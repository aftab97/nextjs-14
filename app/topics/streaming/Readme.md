# Streaming #
Streaming is a data transfer technique that allows you to break down a route into smaller "chunks" and progressively stream them from the server to the client as they become ready.

There are two ways you implement streaming in Next.js:

- At the page level, with the `loading.tsx` file.
- For specific components, with `<Suspense>.`
